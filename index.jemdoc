== Research
My research interests lie in the field of systems and control. I aim to develop a systems and control theory that is grounded on measured data. I work towards mapping raw data into models and control policies with rigorous guarantees on accuracy, stability and performance,
while answering key questions such as: /how much data is needed?/ /how to handle noise?/ and /how to perform control-relevant experiments?/

Some of the specific topics of interest are:
- Direct data-driven control 
- System identifiability
- Kernel-based identification of (physical) dynamical systems
- Experiment design 
- Applications to networked systems and neuroscience

We have recently approached the question of how much data is required for control via the concept of /informativity/, which is explored for several control problems in:
- [https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00468 Data informativity: a new perspective for data-driven analysis and control]

To address robustness of controllers with respect to noise and bounded nonlinearities, I have worked on generalizations of the S-lemma and Finsler's lemma: 
- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12959 Quadratic matrix inequalities with applications to data-based control]
- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00870 From noisy data to feedback controllers: non-conservative design via a matrix S-lemma]
- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13461 A matrix Finsler's lemma with applications to data-driven control]

Kernel-based modeling for systems with (incremental) dissipativity properties is treated in the papers: 
- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11735 Kernel-based models for system analysis]
- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03344 Training Lipschitz continuous operators using reproducing kernels]

Some other recent work involves the problem of experiment design:
- [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9882335 A persistency of excitation condition for continuous-time systems]
- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11193 Beyond persistent excitation: online experiment design for data-driven modeling and control]
- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01023 Willems' fundamental lemma for state-space systems and its extension to multiple datasets]
