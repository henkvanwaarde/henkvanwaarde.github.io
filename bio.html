<h1>Bio and CV</h1>
</div>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I received the Ph.D. degree in Systems and Control from the University of Groningen, The Netherlands in 2020, under supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.math.rug.nl/~kanat/">Kanat Camlibel</a> and Professor <a href="https://www.unifi.it/p-doc2-0-0-A-3f2b342f322930.html">Pietro Tesi</a>.
Before this, I obtained the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Applied Mathematics from the same university, in 2014 and 2016 respectively. 
My Master's thesis project was supervised by Professor <a href="https://www.math.rug.nl/~trentelman/">Harry Trentelman</a> and Professor Kanat Camlibel. </p>
<h2>Work </h2>
<p>I am an assistant professor at the <a href="https://www.rug.nl">University of Groningen</a>, where I work in the <a href="https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/groups/sco/">Systems, Control and Optimization group</a> within the <a href="https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/?lang=en">Bernoulli Institute</a>.
I am a member of the <a href="https://www.rug.nl/research/fse/themes/dssc/about-dssc/">Centre for Data Science and Systems Complexity</a> and the
<a href="https://jcwcenter.web.rug.nl/">Jan C. Willems Center for Systems and Control</a>.</p>
<p>Before this, I held postdoctoral research positions. During 2020-2021 I was a postdoc at Cambridge University, UK, working with Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/rsepulchre/">Rodolphe Sepulchre</a>. 
In the last three months of 2021, I was a short-term postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zürich, Switzerland, where I worked in the group of Professor <a href="http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~floriand/">Florian Dörfler</a>. 
During 2019-2020 I was a visiting researcher at the University of Washington, Seattle, USA, where I worked under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/mesbahi/about-me-4">Mehran Mesbahi</a>. 
<br /><br /> 
I am the recipient of the <a href="http://ieeecss.org/awards/ieee-control-systems-letters-outstanding-paper-award"><i>2021 IEEE Control Systems Letters Outstanding Paper Award</i></a> for <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9062331">this paper</a> on Willems&rsquo; lemma, coauthored with Claudio De Persis, Kanat Camlibel and Pietro Tesi. 
I received the Ph.D. degree with the iudicium <i>cum laude</i>, the highest distinction for Ph.D. students that is given to the top 5% dissertations in The Netherlands. 
My Ph.D. thesis was awarded the <i>2020 DISC Best Ph.D. Thesis Award</i> by the <a href="http://disc.tudelft.nl/about/">Dutch Institute of Systems and Control</a>,
the <i>Best Ph.D. Thesis Award in Mathematics</i> by the Bernoulli Institute at the University of Groningen, and the <i>EECI Ph.D. Thesis Award</i> by the <a href="http://www.eeci-igsc.eu/">European Embedded Control Institute</a>.
In 2019, I was the recipient of the <i>Best Junior Presentation Award</i> at the Benelux Meeting on Systems and Control.
Before that, I obtained the Master's degree <i>summa cum laude</i>, and the Bachelor's degree with the iudicium <i>cum laude</i>.
<br /><br />
My research interests lie in the field of systems and control. I aim to develop a systems and control theory that is grounded on measured data. Some of the topics I work on
are data-driven control, system identification and experiment design with applications to networked systems and neuroscience. 
I am also interested in connections to machine learning (especially through reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces), and further enjoy working on structural controllability analysis. 
<br /><br />
In 2020 I co-organized a <a href="https://sites.google.com/rug.nl/cdc2020datadrivencontrol">workshop on data-driven control</a> at the <a href="https://cdc2020.ieeecss.org/workshops.php">IEEE Conference on Decision and Control</a>.
From 2017 until 2020 I was also a student member of the council of the <a href="http://disc.tudelft.nl/about/">Dutch Institute of Systems and Control</a>.
I am a reviewer for different journals such as <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/automatica">Automatica</a>, 
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7782633">IEEE Control Systems Letters</a> and 
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=9">IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</a>, and conferences such as
ACC, CDC, ECC and IFAC World Congress. 
<br /><br />
My complete CV is available upon request. </p>
<h2>Further interests</h2>
<p>Besides science, I enjoy hiking in places like the Swiss Alps and the Cascades.
I am also passionate about classical music. Bach is my go-to composer for unmatched counterpoint and creativity. 
I highly recommend the quality recordings of the <a href="https://www.bachvereniging.nl/en/allofbach">All of Bach</a> project, 
for example the <a href="https://www.bachvereniging.nl/en/bwv/bwv-1052r/">(reconstructed) Violin Concerto in D minor</a>, the <a href="https://www.bachvereniging.nl/en/bwv/bwv-244/">Matthäus Passion</a>, 
and the -beyond this world technical- <a href="https://www.bachvereniging.nl/en/bwv/bwv-530/">Trio Sonata in G major</a> (recorded in the Groninger &ldquo;Oethoezn&rdquo;). 
For more Romantic ideas, Mahler's symphonies are all splendid and it is difficult to pick a favorite. 
I have grown to like both their turmoil and tranquility, although I recently lean more towards the latter in his
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ividyw_WPv4&amp;ab_channel=Cantus5">Fourth Symphony</a>. </p>
