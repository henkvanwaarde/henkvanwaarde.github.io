== Bio and CV

== Education

I received the Ph.D. degree in Systems and Control from the University of Groningen, The Netherlands in 2020, under supervision of Professor [http://www.math.rug.nl/~kanat/ Kanat Camlibel] and Professor [https://www.unifi.it/p-doc2-0-0-A-3f2b342f322930.html Pietro Tesi].
Before this, I obtained the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Applied Mathematics from the same university, in 2014 and 2016 respectively. 
My Master's thesis project was supervised by Professor [https://www.math.rug.nl/~trentelman/ Harry Trentelman] and Professor Kanat Camlibel. 

== Work 

I am an assistant professor at the [https://www.rug.nl University of Groningen], where I work in the [https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/groups/sco/ Systems, Control and Optimization group] within the [https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/?lang=en Bernoulli Institute].
I am a member of the [https://www.rug.nl/research/fse/themes/dssc/about-dssc/ Centre for Data Science and Systems Complexity] and the
[https://jcwcenter.web.rug.nl/ Jan C. Willems Center for Systems and Control].

Before this, I held postdoctoral research positions. During 2020-2021 I was a postdoc at Cambridge University, UK, working with Professor [https://sites.google.com/site/rsepulchre/ Rodolphe Sepulchre]. 
In the last three months of 2021, I was a short-term postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zürich, Switzerland, where I worked in the group of Professor [http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~floriand/ Florian Dörfler]. 
During 2019-2020 I was a visiting researcher at the University of Washington, Seattle, USA, where I worked under the supervision of Professor [http://faculty.washington.edu/mesbahi/about-me-4 Mehran Mesbahi]. 
\n\n 
I am the recipient of the [http://ieeecss.org/awards/ieee-control-systems-letters-outstanding-paper-award /2021 IEEE Control Systems Letters Outstanding Paper Award/] for [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9062331 this paper] on Willems' lemma, coauthored with Claudio De Persis, Kanat Camlibel and Pietro Tesi. 
I received the Ph.D. degree with the iudicium /cum laude/, the highest distinction for Ph.D. students that is given to the top 5% dissertations in The Netherlands. 
My Ph.D. thesis was awarded the /2020 DISC Best Ph.D. Thesis Award/, a prize that is awarded annually by the [http://disc.tudelft.nl/about/ Dutch Institute of Systems and Control],
and the /Best Ph.D. Thesis Award in Mathematics/ of the Bernoulli Institute at the University of Groningen.
In 2019, I was the recipient of the /Best Junior Presentation Award/ at the Benelux Meeting on Systems and Control.
Before that, I obtained the Master's degree /summa cum laude/, and the Bachelor's degree with the iudicium /cum laude/.
\n\n
My research interests lie in the field of systems and control. I aim to develop a systems and control theory that is grounded on measured data. Some of the topics I work on
are data-driven control, system identification and experiment design with applications to networked systems and neuroscience. 
I am also interested in connections to machine learning (especially through reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces), and further enjoy working on structural controllability analysis. 
\n\n
In 2020 I co-organized a [https://sites.google.com/rug.nl/cdc2020datadrivencontrol workshop on data-driven control] at the [https://cdc2020.ieeecss.org/workshops.php#t03 
IEEE Conference on Decision and Control].
From 2017 until 2020 I was also a student member of the council of the [http://disc.tudelft.nl/about/ Dutch Institute of Systems and Control].
I am a reviewer for different journals such as [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/automatica Automatica], 
[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7782633 IEEE Control Systems Letters] and 
[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=9 IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control], and conferences such as
ACC, CDC, ECC and IFAC World Congress.

My complete CV is available upon request. 

== Further interests

Besides science, I enjoy hiking in places like the Swiss Alps and the Cascades.
I am also passionate about classical music. Bach is my go-to composer for unmatched counterpoint and creativity. 
I highly recommend the quality recordings of the [https://www.bachvereniging.nl/en/allofbach All of Bach] project, 
for example the [https://www.bachvereniging.nl/en/bwv/bwv-1052r/ (reconstructed) Violin Concerto in D minor], the [https://www.bachvereniging.nl/en/bwv/bwv-244/ Matthäus Passion], 
and the -beyond this world technical- [https://www.bachvereniging.nl/en/bwv/bwv-530/ Trio Sonata in G major] (recorded in the Groninger "Oethoezn"). 
For more Romantic ideas, Mahler's symphonies are all splendid and it is difficult to pick a favorite. 
I have grown to like both their turmoil and tranquility, although I recently lean more towards the latter in his
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ividyw_WPv4&ab_channel=Cantus5 Fourth Symphony].
